# Rock Band and Guitar Hero Peripheral Documentation

This folder contains documentation on how to communicate with and interpret the data of RB/GH peripherals.

## Contributions

These docs are a work in progress, contributions are very welcome!

To get started, use one of the templates in the [_Templates](_Templates/) folder. Fill out information required to identify the device, include any device descriptors if possible, and give a writeup on how its input data works. Code examples (including data structures) are also appreciated. If you're missing info, be sure to make note of such.

You may add images to documentation, and you may also create an `_Ignored` folder anywhere within the repository to have a folder you can put anything in without fear of accidentally committing it.

## General Notes

When using any data structures included in these documents, you'll want to make sure that they are unaligned and have no packing applied to them, unless otherwise specified.
