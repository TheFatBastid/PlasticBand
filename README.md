# PlasticBand

A repository of documentation on how to interface with and interpret the input data of the Rock Band and Guitar Hero peripherals.

## Plans

This may evolve into an actual library, it's something I've wanted to do for quite some time! For now though, the scope is limited to simply information. However, I *am* creating a Unity package to add support for everything to the Unity InputSystem package: https://github.com/TheNathannator/PlasticBand-Unity

## Licenses

The documentation found in [Docs](Docs/) is licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).

If this project becomes a library, the source code for that library will be under a separate license that will be determined at that point.
